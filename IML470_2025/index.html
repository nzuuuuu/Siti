  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Zulaikha, and I am a professional librarian who works in the field of Digital Information Services. My job is to help people such as students, researchers, teachers, and the public to find, access, and use the right information easily. In today’s digital age, it is very important to know how to search for information online and use it in the correct way. That is why I am here to guide and support others through this process.</p>

  <p>I have a strong interest in information science, technology, and education. I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others learn.

  <p>Through my work, I hope to build a strong connection between people and information by using the latest technology and creative ideas. I want to inspire more people to explore the world of digital knowledge and become confident information users.</p>

  <h2>Auralis Library Project</h2>
  <p>I am proud to be part of the Auralis Library Project, Malaysia’s first futuristic archive that focuses on drama, theatre, and performing arts. This special library is not just a place for books. It is a creative space where drama lives in many exciting ways. The Auralis Library brings together technology, arts, and people to celebrate storytelling through drama.</p>

  <p>The vision of Auralis is to become Southeast Asia’s top knowledge center for drama and performance. We collect and preserve scripts, videos, and other drama-related materials. We also create new ways for people to experience drama using modern tools such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

  <p>Some of the amazing features include VR Drama Pods where visitors can explore scenes from famous shows, AI-powered script readers that read scripts out loud with emotions, and a Hologram Gallery where characters from drama stories come to life. We also have a Digital Script Archive, a cozy Drama Lounge, and an Interactive Stage where visitors can act and perform with sound and lighting effects.</p>

  <p>In this project, I manage digital collections, design user-friendly experiences, and help plan workshops and events for students and the public. I work closely with a creative team including script experts, VR and AI specialists, and community librarians. Together, we aim to make drama more interactive, accessible, and fun for everyone from students and artists to families and cultural visitors.</p>

  <p>We believe that stories should not be trapped on a screen or page. They should be felt, lived, and experienced. That is what Auralis stands for: <strong>"Where Stories Live Beyond the Screen."</strong></p>
